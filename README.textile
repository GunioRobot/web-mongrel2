h3. web-mongrel2

This library attempts to abstract away some the details of connecting Haskell web frameworks to Mongrel2.

h3. Status

Very basic communication.  Only really tested with basic GET and POST requests.

h3. Examples

Take a look at <a href="/cmoore/hack-handler-mongrel2">hack-handler-mongrel2</a> for an example of a working, although quite simple, framework.
